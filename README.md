High-level, pluggable market data API for Rust. This monorepo contains the shared domain types, the core traits, the router/orchestrator, and the officially supported provider connector.

## Workspace layout

### Core Infrastructure

- **`borsa-types`**: Shared domain types (error, reports, configuration, attribution)
- **`borsa-core`**: Connector traits, time-series utilities, and re-exports from `paft` and `borsa-types`
- **`borsa`**: High-level router that merges/prioritizes multiple connectors with fallback support
- **`borsa-mock`**: Mock connector with deterministic fixture data for testing and examples

### Official Connectors (Tier 1)

These connectors are fully supported, comprehensively tested, and maintained by the core team:

- **`borsa-yfinance`**: Yahoo Finance connector (no API key required) - **Reference implementation**

### Best-Effort Connectors (Tier 2)

These connectors are maintained on a best-effort basis and may lag behind breaking changes in `borsa-core`. Community contributions and PRs are welcome:

- [`borsa-alphavantage`](https://github.com/borsaorg/borsa-alphavantage): Alpha Vantage connector (API key required)
- `borsa-cmc`: CoinMarketCap connector (coming soon - API key required)

### Community Connectors (Tier 3)

Want to add a connector for your preferred data provider? We provide:

- Complete connector SDK documentation
- Reference implementations (`borsa-yfinance` and `borsa-mock`)
- CI templates and testing utilities
- We'll list your connector here and help review PRs

**For data providers**: Want official Tier 1 support and priority maintenance for your API? [Contact us](mailto:contact@borsa.rs) about sponsorship opportunities.

### Examples

- **`borsa/examples/`**: Self-contained example programs demonstrating common workflows

For crate-specific usage of the high-level client, see [borsa/README.md](https://github.com/borsaorg/borsa/blob/main/borsa/README.md).

## Versioning and compatibility contract

- **Official crates move in lockstep**: `borsa`, `borsa-core`, and `borsa-yfinance` always share the same version.
- **Minor series is the compatibility boundary**: Within a given series `v0.X.*`, breaking changes are avoided. All `v0.X.*` releases of the official crates are mutually compatible.
- **Connector contract**: A community connector released as `v0.X.Y` must be compatible with any `borsa` release in `v0.X.*`, and vice‑versa.
- **Out of range**: Combinations across different minor series (e.g. `v0.1.*` with `v0.2.*`) are unsupported.
- **Breaking changes**: We may bump the minor series (e.g. `0.1 → 0.2`) at any time to introduce breaking changes, which can render older connectors outdated.

## Install (as a user of the library)

Add the crates you need to your project:

```toml
[dependencies]
borsa = "0.2.0"
borsa-yfinance = "0.2.0"
# Optional: only needed directly for advanced usage
# borsa-types = "0.2.0"
```

## Quickstart

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use borsa::Borsa;
use borsa_core::{AssetKind, Instrument};
use borsa_yfinance::YfConnector;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let yf = Arc::new(YfConnector::new_default());
    let borsa = Borsa::builder().with_connector(yf).build()?;

    let aapl = Instrument::from_symbol("AAPL", AssetKind::Equity)?;
    let q = borsa.quote(&aapl).await?;
    if let Some(price) = &q.price {
        println!(
            "{} last price: {}",
            q.symbol.as_str(),
            price.format()
        );
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

## DataFrames

`borsa` builds on [`paft`](https://github.com/paft-rs/paft). Enabling the `dataframe` feature on `borsa` activates paft's Polars integration, allowing you to call `.to_dataframe()` on returned types.

To enable it:

```toml
[dependencies]
borsa = { version = "0.2", features = ["dataframe"] }
```

Usage:

```rust
use borsa_core::ToDataFrame; // same as paft::dataframe::ToDataFrame; 
let quote = borsa.quote(&aapl).await?;
let df = quote.to_dataframe()?; // polars::DataFrame
```

## Router configuration highlights

- Prefer adjusted history when merging overlaps:

```rust
let borsa = Borsa::builder()
    .prefer_adjusted_history(true)
    .build()?;
```

- Resample merged history (daily or weekly):

```rust
use borsa::Resampling;
let borsa = Borsa::builder()
    .resampling(Resampling::Weekly)
    .build()?;
```

- Composable provider routing (symbol/kind/exchange) and strict rules:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use borsa_core::{AssetKind, BorsaConnector, Exchange, RoutingPolicyBuilder};
let yf = Arc::new(YfConnector::new_default());
let av = Arc::new(AvConnector::new_with_key("..."));

let routing = RoutingPolicyBuilder::new()
    // Kind-level default ordering
    .providers_for_kind(AssetKind::Equity, &[yf.key(), av.key()])
    // Symbol override
    .providers_for_symbol("AAPL", &[av.key(), yf.key()])
    // Exchange override (e.g., prefer Yahoo for NASDAQ)
    .providers_for_exchange(Exchange::try_from_str("NASDAQ").unwrap(), &[yf.key(), av.key()])
    // Strict rule (no fallback) for Crypto: only Yahoo will be attempted
    .providers_rule(
        borsa_core::Selector { symbol: None, kind: Some(AssetKind::Crypto), exchange: None },
        &[yf.key()],
        true,
    )
    .build();

let borsa = Borsa::builder()
    .with_connector(yf.clone())
    .with_connector(av.clone())
    .routing_policy(routing)
    .build()?;
```

Note on routing semantics:

- Provider rules: the most specific matching rule wins (counts set fields among `symbol`, `kind`, `exchange`). If equally specific, the rule that sets the highest-precedence field (Symbol > Kind > Exchange) wins; if still tied, the last-defined rule wins. `strict` rules disable fallback to unlisted providers.
- Exchange preferences: used for search de-duplication only and resolve by Symbol > Kind > Global.

Migration note: the old builder methods `prefer_for_kind` and `prefer_symbol` are replaced by `routing_policy(...)`. Use `RoutingPolicyBuilder` to declare preferences at symbol/kind/exchange scopes and optional `strict` rules.

## Examples

Browse `borsa/examples/` for end-to-end samples (quotes, history, fundamentals, options, news, ESG, analysis). These are small, copyable programs you can adapt in your own project.

### Running examples locally (CI-safe)

Examples dynamically select the connector at runtime via the `BORSA_EXAMPLES_USE_MOCK` environment variable:

- When set, examples use the deterministic `borsa-mock::MockConnector` (no network access)
- When unset, examples use the live `borsa-yfinance::YfConnector`

Run all examples against the live API (prints example outputs):

```bash
just examples
```

Run all example checks locally using the mock (CI-safe):

```bash
just examples-mock
```

Run a specific example with the mock:

```bash
BORSA_EXAMPLES_USE_MOCK=1 cargo run -p borsa --example 01_simple_quote
```

Run a specific example against live Yahoo Finance:

```bash
cargo run -p borsa --example 01_simple_quote
```

## Observability (tracing)

The workspace provides optional, feature-gated tracing spans across the router (`borsa`), core orchestration, and the Yahoo Finance connector (`borsa-yfinance`).

- Enable features: `borsa/tracing` and `borsa-yfinance/tracing`
- Initialize a subscriber in your binary using `tracing-subscriber`
- See `borsa/examples/00_tracing.rs` for a minimal setup

Quickstart:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info,borsa=trace,borsa_yfinance=trace \
  cargo run -p borsa --example 00_tracing \
  --features "borsa/tracing borsa-yfinance/tracing"
```

Notes:

- Spans are attached to high-level router entry points and to core helpers that drive provider selection.
- `borsa-yfinance` instruments all public provider endpoints so you can see per-capability timing.
