# borsa-types

Shared data transfer objects and configuration types for the Borsa ecosystem, built on top of the [`paft`](https://github.com/paft-rs/paft) primitives. The crate collects report envelopes, attribution helpers, and orchestrator configuration structures that are reused across the `borsa-*` crates.***
